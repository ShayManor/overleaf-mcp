"""tests/test_tool_safety_annotations.py — every tool declares its safety hints.

WHY THIS GUARD EXISTS (measured, 2026-07-29)
--------------------------------------------
``annotations.readOnlyHint`` is a CONTROL SIGNAL, not documentation. A host
cannot know whether a tool mutates anything, so a careful one assumes the
worst: Tofu's ``lib/tasks_pkg/tool_dispatch/_flags.py`` puts every MCP tool
into the WRITE partition (serial dispatch + approval-eligible) unless the tool
says ``readOnlyHint: true``.

This package shipped 25 tools with ZERO annotations, so a purely read-only
workflow — open a project, list files, read a few, diff two revisions — ran
one-call-at-a-time with an approval prompt on every step.

WHAT THE ASSERTIONS PIN, AND WHY BY NAME
-----------------------------------------
Every tool is asserted BY NAME, not by count. A count assertion passes just as
happily when two tools swap sides, and the swap that matters is the dangerous
one: a mutating tool mislabelled read-only rejoins the parallel pool AND stops
asking for approval. ``delete_file`` is the worst case and is pinned twice.

A tool absent from both tables is a FAILURE rather than a default, because the
default (write) is silent: the author never learns they skipped the decision.

THE CLASSIFICATION IS DERIVED FROM BEHAVIOUR, NOT FROM THE NAME
----------------------------------------------------------------
The spec's test is "the tool does not modify its ENVIRONMENT" — wider than
"does not modify the Overleaf project". Seven tools that *sound* like reads
fail that test, and each is pinned here with its reason:

  * ``compile_project`` / ``download_log`` / ``get_page_count`` /
    ``locate_in_pdf`` / ``section_page_map`` run a COMPILE on Overleaf's
    servers (``layout._compile_with_editor_id`` mirrors
    ``compile.compile_project``). Returning information does not make an
    operation read-only; what it does to obtain that information is the test.
  * ``download_pdf`` / ``download_source_zip`` / ``download_source`` write to
    the user's filesystem at a caller-supplied path, and ``download_source``
    clobbers a non-empty directory when ``overwrite=true``.
