# 🍃 Overleaf MCP Server

The most comprehensive [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server for [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com).

**18 tools** covering full CRUD, LaTeX structure analysis, git history & diff, PDF compilation, and download — all from your AI assistant.

**Simple setup** — set two environment variables (`OVERLEAF_SESSION`, optional `OVERLEAF_GIT_TOKEN`) when registering the MCP server, and you're done.

```
You: "List my projects"
AI:  [list_projects] You have 5 projects. Which one?

You: "Read main.tex from my thesis"
AI:  [read_file] Here's the content: …

You: "Rewrite the abstract to be more concise"
AI:  [edit_file] ✓ Edited and pushed

You: "Compile and download the PDF"
AI:  [compile_project + download_pdf] PDF saved to ~/Desktop/thesis.pdf ✓
```

> Note: earlier versions shipped an `overleaf_setup` / `overleaf_save_credentials` wizard. These tools have been removed — credentials are now read straight from environment variables.

## ✨ Key Advantages

- **21 tools** — the most of any Overleaf MCP server
- **Zero config** — just two env vars, no config files, no per-project setup
- **Dual auth** — Git tokens for read/write + session cookies for compile/download
- **Surgical edits** — `edit_file` does exact search-and-replace (like `sed`), not full rewrites
- **LaTeX-aware** — section hierarchy parsing with indented previews
- **Git history & diff** — review changes, compare versions, filter by file/date
- **Compilation** — trigger builds and download PDFs without leaving your AI chat
- **Compilation logs** — `download_log` for debugging LaTeX errors
- **Page-layout perception** — `get_page_count` / `locate_in_pdf` / `section_page_map` expose *where* content lands in the rendered PDF (via SyncTeX), so the AI can answer "which page is section X on?" and drive a fill-exactly-N-pages loop
- **Thread-safe** — per-project locks prevent concurrent git corruption
- **Clean Python** — modular architecture, type hints, async throughout

## 📦 Installation

### Option 1: pip (recommended)

The package is published on PyPI as **`overleaf-mcp-plus`** (the plain
`overleaf-mcp` name was taken by an unrelated project). The CLI entry
point is still `overleaf-mcp`.

```bash
# Core (git-based tools only)
pip install overleaf-mcp-plus

# With compile/download support (recommended)
pip install "overleaf-mcp-plus[compile]"
```

Or run directly without installing, via `uvx`:

```bash
uvx --from "overleaf-mcp-plus[compile]" overleaf-mcp
```

### Option 2: From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rangehow/overleaf-mcp.git
cd overleaf-mcp
pip install -e .

# Or with uv
uv venv && uv pip install -e .
```

### Option 3: Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rangehow/overleaf-mcp.git
cd overleaf-mcp
docker compose build
```

---

## 🔧 Setup

Configure credentials via environment variables. There are two credentials
for two different sets of features — you can supply either or both.

### Step 1 — Get the session cookie (required)

The `overleaf_session2` cookie is **HttpOnly**, so it can only be read
from the browser's DevTools panel (not from JavaScript / the console).

1. Log into <https://www.overleaf.com>.
2. Press <kbd>F12</kbd> → **Application** tab (Firefox: *Storage*; Safari:
   *Storage*).
3. Expand **Cookies → https://www.overleaf.com**.
4. Copy the **Value** of the row named `overleaf_session2`. It starts
   with `s%3A…`.

### Step 2 — Get the git token (optional, for edit tools)

1. Open <https://www.overleaf.com/user/settings>.
2. Scroll to **Git Integration → Create Token**.
3. Copy the token (it starts with `olp_`; shown only once).

### Step 3 — Pass them to the server

Point your MCP client at `overleaf-mcp` and provide the env vars. In
Claude Desktop / Claude Code (`claude_desktop_config.json` or `.mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "overleaf": {
      "command": "overleaf-mcp",
      "env": {
        "OVERLEAF_SESSION": "s%3A...",
        "OVERLEAF_GIT_TOKEN": "olp_..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In chatui's MCP catalog the **Overleaf** card prompts for these two fields
at install time — no shell setup needed.

### Two credentials, different purposes

| Credential | What you can do | When you need it |
|---|---|---|
| **Session cookie** (`overleaf_session2`) | `list_projects`, compile, download PDF, download log, create project | Works on the free tier. Expires ~30 days — refresh when tools start failing with auth errors. |
| **Git token** (`olp_...`) | Read/write/edit files, commit history, diffs | Optional. Only if you want to edit files. Requires a paid plan. |

You can start with just the cookie and add the git token later.

### All Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `OVERLEAF_SESSION` | Session cookie. Required for list_projects / compile / pdf / create_project. |
| `OVERLEAF_GIT_TOKEN` | Git token. Required for read / edit / history / diff tools. |
| `OVERLEAF_BASE_URL` | Overleaf URL (default: `https://www.overleaf.com`) |
| `OVERLEAF_GIT_HOST` | Git host (default: `git.overleaf.com`) |
| `OVERLEAF_TEMP_DIR` | Local git cache (default: `./overleaf_cache`) |
| `OVERLEAF_GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` | Git author name (default: `Overleaf MCP`) |
| `OVERLEAF_GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL` | Git author email (default: `mcp@overleaf.local`) |
| `HISTORY_LIMIT_DEFAULT` | Default commit limit (default: `20`) |
| `HISTORY_LIMIT_MAX` | Max commit limit (default: `200`) |
| `DIFF_CONTEXT_LINES` | Diff context lines (default: `3`) |
| `DIFF_MAX_OUTPUT_CHARS` | Max diff size (default: `120000`) |

---

## 🔌 Client Setup

### Docker

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "overleaf": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["compose", "run", "--rm", "-T", "mcp"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/overleaf-mcp",
      "env": {
        "OVERLEAF_SESSION": "s%3A...",
        "OVERLEAF_GIT_TOKEN": "olp_..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

(For Claude Desktop / Claude Code see the setup section above.)

### Server on another machine (ssh)

If `overleaf-mcp` runs on a different host, `upload_file` reads `source_path`
on that host, so a path on your laptop fails. Put `overleaf-mcp-proxy` in
front of the ssh command instead. It pipes the MCP stream through untouched
and, for an `upload_file` whose `source_path` exists locally, streams the
file to the host first and rewrites the path. It holds no credentials.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "overleaf": {
      "command": "overleaf-mcp-proxy",
      "args": [
        "--host", "minipc",
        "--",
        "set -a; . ~/.config/overleaf-mcp/env; set +a; exec ~/src/overleaf-mcp/.venv/bin/overleaf-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Everything after `--` is the command that starts the server on the host.
In-flight files go to `~/.cache/overleaf-mcp/inbox/<id>/` on the host, and the
proxy removes them once the server answers. `--inbox DIR` changes the location.
Each upload opens two ssh connections (copy, cleanup), so `ControlMaster`
in `~/.ssh/config` makes them near-instant. Downloads (`download_pdf`,
`download_source`) still write on the host.

ssh must authenticate without prompting. A passphrase prompt or an
unaccepted host key leaves the proxy stalled with no visible error, so use
a key loaded in an agent and connect once by hand first to accept the host
key.

The remote shell must print nothing on stdout: anything a remote startup
file prints lands in the JSON-RPC stream and breaks every tool.

Install the package on the laptop as well as the host, since the proxy
runs locally.

| `locate_in_pdf` | Find which page (and bounding box) a given source line lands on, via SyncTeX |
| `section_page_map` | Map every section/subsection heading (and `\end{document}`) to its PDF page, plus **two fullness figures for the last page**: against the physical page (real height from the PDF MediaBox — correct for A4/Letter/custom `geometry`) *and* against the printable text body (bottom margin excluded, derived from the log's `geometry` dump) with a rough "N more lines fit" estimate. The text-area figure is the actionable one for a fill-exactly-N-pages workflow — the "where is each element on the page" overview. Built by parsing `output.synctex.gz` **offline** (one artifact download + local decode, ~ms for the whole map) rather than one HTTP call per section, so it's O(1) requests and stays fast + reliable on long papers; falls back to the live `sync/code` endpoint if the artifact is missing |

## 🪪 Local-copy metadata sidecar

Whenever `download_source` extracts a project to a local directory, or
`ensure_repo` clones one into the git cache, the server drops a small
`.overleaf-project.json` file at the root of that copy:

```json
{
  "project_id": "69e46cd469c0fc49d2627320",
  "name": "[阿布] 毕业论文魔改版",
  "overleaf_url": "https://www.overleaf.com/project/69e46cd469c0fc49d2627320",
  "source": "zip",
  "downloaded_at": "2026-04-22T10:54:55+00:00"
}
```

This lets any tool (including an AI assistant) unambiguously identify
which Overleaf project a local working directory corresponds to — no
more guessing by file names. For git-backed copies the file is added to
`.git/info/exclude` so it is never pushed back to Overleaf.

## 🔒 Security

- Credentials are read only from environment variables — nothing is persisted to disk by the server
- Path traversal protection on all file operations
- Per-project thread locks prevent concurrent git corruption
- Session cookie expiry surfaces as a clear auth error, prompting the user to refresh `OVERLEAF_SESSION`
